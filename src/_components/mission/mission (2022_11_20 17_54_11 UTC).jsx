                stepped foot into her new home. Her son, the one who she had been a caretaker to for 
                his whole life had switched roles with her. She went from being the director of his life 
                to having no say in his decision to cast her out of the show. "Looking back at it now, yes
                I was envious - and rightfully so - but that envy turned into hopelessness in mere days." 
                She continued on, "You know that question that pops up in your head whenever your having a mid-life crisis?
                What's the meaning of life? For me, it was having a legacy - having a footprint on the world
                and part of that hopelessness came from knowing I wouldn't ever have an 
                impact on the world again, my footprint on the world was already finished because of this
                prison"

                <div className='title1'>Be Real
                <div className='bodyt3'> Transparency is one of our biggest ideals. This is because creating meaningful and lasting
                relations is our goal. It's easy to pity the residents, but understanding that some of the people we visit
                have years more of experience and knowledge is a trait we value

                <div className='title2-3'>Make Impact<div className='bodyt3'> SCF is also a place where driven people meet supporters. Lizzy, for example,
                just needed someone to be her arms and feet. Driven people, passionate about certain causes finding their mentors and supporters is one 
                of our goals

                <div className='title2-3'>Create Change<div className='bodyt3'> Another goal we have isn't only to create change, but to create 
                a change that lasts. Keeping in touch with residents through consistent letters, or scheduling visits are just a few of the many ways we 
                achieve that standard
